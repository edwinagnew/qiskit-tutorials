# Here is a list of my qiskit tutorials

## 1. Quantum Teleportation
Follow along with my [medium article about implementing quantum teleportation with qiskit and IBM Q experience](https://medium.com/@edwinagnew1/quantum-teleportation-from-scratch-to-magic-part-2-doing-it-on-a-real-device-25be7386a158).

Two of the notebooks are from the [this article explaining how teleportation works](https://medium.com/@edwinagnew1/quantum-teleportation-from-scratch-to-magic-part-3-a-new-theory-of-time-feb8684d952b) which includes a test for reversibility maps of circuits and a test of the principle of deferred mesaurement.
